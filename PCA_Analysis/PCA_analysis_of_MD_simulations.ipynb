    "### Using PCA for the Analysis of MD Simulations\n",

    "The aim of the notebook is to illustrate methods we can use to assess convergence and sampling in MD trajectories. You will compare and contrast the most basic and widely-used method to do this - RMSD analysis - with the use of more sophisticated PCA based approaches. You will apply the approaches to two common scenarios: firstly the comparison of the dynamics of a protein the presence and absence of a bound ligand, and secondly the evaluation of sampling and convergence in an ensemble of independent, replicate, MD trajectories of a protein.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the process, you will see how iPython (Jupyter) notebooks help with interactive data exploration and analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. you have a basic understanding of how to use an iPython (Jupyter) notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. you already have a basic understanding of PCA methods. For much more information about the PCA package used here - **pyPcazip** -, see [here](https://bitbucket.org/ramonbsc/pypcazip) and the paper [Shkurti et al., SoftwareX](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2016.04.002).\n",
    "\n",
    "**pyPcazip** uses a python library called **MDPlus** and that is mainly what you will see in action here. For a guide to the **MDPlus** API, see [here](http://pypcazip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)."
