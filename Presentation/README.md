# Setting up and Running Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Good Practice and Pitfalls

## Abstract: 
Whether you are a user of Amber, Charmm, Gromacs, NAMD or any other MD package, there are a good number of on-line tutorials that will take you through the mechanics of setting up and running an MD simulation. However in general there is less discussion in these about how to ensure you end up with a good simulation. In this workshop we will explore some of the issues in simulation preparation and analysis that can trip up the unwary, and how to avoid them.

## The Presentation: 
This folder contains a [copy of the notes](CCPBioSim\ Leeds\ -\ Analysis\ of\ MD\ Simulations.pdf) associated with the (Powerpoint) presentation that kicks off this workshop, and also includes copies of the two PDB files ([2oz2.pdb](2oz2.pdb) and [5sxy.pdb](5sxy.pdb)) that are used in the interactive portions of the presentation.
