    "# Procheck analysis of an NMR ensemble\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates how you can use Python to automate the process of performing a Procheck analysis of each model in the PDB file of an NMR ensemble - in this case entry 5sxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook makes use of three Python packages:\n",
    " - [collections](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html): part of the standard Python library, provides a 'better' sort of dictionary.\n",
    " - [mdtraj](http://www.mdtraj.org): a very useful trajectory analysis package.\n",
    " - [xbowflow](https://github.com/ChrisSuess/Project-Xbow/wiki/An-Introduction-to-Xbowflow-Workflows): a library for making command line tools work like Python functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "You must have the Python packages `mdtraj` and `xbowflow` installed, and `Procheck` installed too.\n",
    "\n",
    "MDTraj and xbowflow can be installed using `pip`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "% pip install mdtraj\n",
    "% pip install xbowflow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But `Procheck` is not a Python package and can be a bit more effort to install if you don't already have it. If you are lucky enough to be looking at this notebook on your own laptop, or some other computer that has [Docker](http://docker.com) installed, then you can use `pinda` to install `Procheck`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "% pip install pinda\n",
    "% pinda install procheck 3.5.4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need a copy of the PDB file `5sxy.pdb` in the directory you launch this notebook from. If it's not already here, download it from the [PDB website](http://www.rcsb.org/structure/5sxy).\n",
