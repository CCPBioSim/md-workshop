    "# Propka analysis of a protein structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the application of [Propka](https://github.com/jensengroup/propka-3.1) to the analysis of the pKas of acidic and basic residues in the structure of the cysteine protease cruzein (PDB code 2oz2).\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook makes use of two Python packages:\n",
    " - [nglview](http://nglviewer.org/nglview/latest/): A package to embed a molecular viewer in a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    " - [mdtraj](http://www.mdtraj.org): a very useful trajectory analysis package.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "You must have the Python packages `nglviewer` and `mdtraj` installed, and `Procheck` installed too.\n",
    "\n",
    "`MDTraj` and `nglviewer` can be installed using `pip`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "% pip install mdtraj\n",
    "% pip install nglviewer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`Propka` is not a Python package and can be a bit more effort to install if you don't already have it. If you are lucky enough to be looking at this notebook on your own laptop, or some other computer that has [Docker](http://docker.com) installed, then you can use `pinda` to install `Propka`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "% pip install pinda\n",
    "% pinda install propka 3.1.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need a copy of the PDB file `2oz2.pdb` in the directory you launch this notebook from. If it's not already here, download it from the [PDB website](http://www.rcsb.org/structure/2oz2).\n",
