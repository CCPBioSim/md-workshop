# Analysis of MD Trajectories

## Requirements: 
Basic knowledge of the Linux command line.

## Training Material

This workshop consists of a series of Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Basic Analysis**: An introduction to interactive MD data analysis with Jupyter notebooks and MDTraj.
2. **PCA Analysis**: An introduction to the use of Principal Component Analysis methods for the analysis of sampling and convergence of MD simulations.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: An introduction to the use of statistical methods to assess the significance of data extracted from MD simulations.
4. **Ubiquitin Analysis**: Application of some of the methods in the other notebooks to the analysis of data from an MD simulation of ubiquitin.
5. **Prokpka Analysis**: Analysis of a PDB structure using Propka to predict protonation states of acidic and basic residues.
6. **Procheck  Analysis**: A slightly more advanced notebook that demonstartes how you can automate the Procheck analysis of a multi-model PDB file of an NMR-derived protein structure.

These can be run using the 
<a href="https://ccpbiosim.github.io/workshop/events/leeds2019/server.html" target="_blank">workshop jupyter server</a>. 
Once you have started the server, navigate to the `md_workshop` directory and you will find the
notebooks there.
